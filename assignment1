* Context: 
   * Smithsonian Natural History Museum DC 
   * The website lays out the research and collections of the Natural History Museum in DC. 
   * On the website, 148 million items are present from the museum collection which is still growing. 
   * The website also lays out the various locations used by the Smithsonian museums for research. 
   * * Users 
   * The target users are scientists or anyone looking to the past for history. I could be wrong, but that is a guess. And students as well. 
   * Users for the website are also patrons looking to dive into the research part of the museum from another level besides looking there. 
   * The museum website has school programs for school students and educators to use and learn more about the collections. 
Content 
* The website describes the artifacts in the Natural History Museum.  
* The size of the collection is 148 million and still growing. 
* Pros: 
   * The different sections are laid out on the side and in the middle of the webpage for the user to navigate. 
   * Listing facts about the different parts of the museum for the user to pick up on. 
   * Different tabs for the reader to dive deeper on. 
   * Tab for the user to give feedback on the website. 
   * The museum lists daily events for the user to decide on what to do there. 
* Cons 
   * The side tab pops up every now and then pointing users to the different aspects of the website. It pops up on the different tabs of the website. 
   * Improvement 
* I could not find much areas for improvement except getting rid of the pop up tab on the side unless necessary.
