	*Context: 
\
   * Smithsonian Natural History Museum DC 
\
   * The website lays out the research and collections of the Natural History Museum in DC. 
\
   * On the website, 148 million items are present from the museum collection which is still growing. 
\
   * The website also lays out the various locations used by the Smithsonian museums for research. 
\
  <p> * * Users 
\
   * The target users are scientists or anyone looking to the past for history. I could be wrong, but that is a guess. And students as well. 
\
   * Users for the website are also patrons looking to dive into the research part of the museum from another level besides looking there. 
\
   * The museum website has school programs for school students and educators to use and learn more about the collections.
